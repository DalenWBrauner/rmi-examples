 * This package demonstrates a Client connecting to a Server and being
 * told to wait until all other Clients have connected. Once all the Clients are
 * connected, the Server resumes the Clients' threads and allows them to continue
 * on with their business, meaning that all of the Clients resume at once, on the same page,
 * after the Server says so.
